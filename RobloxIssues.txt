### ðŸ”„ Missing Module Errors

- [P] **P1-004**: Module structure and references issues

  - "ModuleManager is not a valid member of Folder 'ReplicatedStorage.Shared'" in client scripts

  - This confirms that module structure is the core issue across the project

- [X] **P1-005**: AchievementManager missing variable definitions

  - Removing unused imports and implementing necessary caching

---

## P2: Medium Priority Issues

### ðŸ”„ Module Structure and References

- [P] **P2-004**: Missing Modules in ReplicatedStorage.Shared
  - Project appears to expect these modules in Shared:
    - ModuleManager (used in Gui:4)
    - RemoteManager (used in ServerScriptService.init:25)
    - Constants (previously referenced in UI scripts)
  - Suggests a need for consistent module implementation in ReplicatedStorage
  
- [X] **P2-005**: BuildingChallengeManager code structure issues
  - Fixed duplicate if blocks by refactoring with a `shouldAward` variable
  - Fixed empty if block implementation
  - Properly prefixed unused parameters with underscore
  - Commented out unused imports

### ðŸ”„ DataStoreManagerPro Issues

- [ ] **P2-006**: Missing modules in DataStoreManagerPro plugin
  - Multiple "Failed to resolve module" errors
  - Modules affected: CacheManager, SchemaManager, SchemaValidator, SessionManager, etc.

- [ ] **P2-007**: UI Component access errors in DataStoreManagerPro
  - Multiple "X is not a valid member of Folder/Script" errors
  - Components: APIIntegration, AccessControl, SchemaManager, StyleGuide, etc.

- [ ] **P2-008**: Invalid callback in DataExplorer
  - "Attempt to connect failed: Passed value is not a function"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src.server.DataExplorer:472

## P3: Low Priority Issues

### ðŸ”„ DataStore Client Access Issues

- [ ] **P3-001**: Client attempting to access DataStore
  - "DataStore can't be accessed from client"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src.server.SessionManager:27

### ðŸ”„ Init Script Issues

- [ ] **P3-002**: Missing init.server script
  - "init.server is not a valid member of Script"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src

### ðŸ”„ Nil Value Calls

- [ ] **P3-003**: Attempting to call nil values
  - "attempt to call a nil value"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src.server.DataExplorer:549

### ðŸ”„ ModuleManager Dependencies

- [ ] **P3-004**: Missing ModuleManager reference
  - "ModuleManager is not a valid member of ModuleScript 'ReplicatedStorage.Shared'"
  - File: Players.Xdjpearsonx.PlayerGui.Gui:4

## Notes and Guidelines

### Key Problem Categories:
1. Path structure and module resolution issues (In progress)
   - Both server and client scripts are failing to find modules
   - The errors show that neither "shared" nor "server" modules can be accessed
   - Project has multiple module reference patterns that aren't working together

2. Missing core modules in ReplicatedStorage.Shared (In progress)
   - ModuleManager, RemoteManager, and Constants all appear to be expected in Shared

3. Multiple instance paths for the same scripts
   - Scripts exist in both `ServerScriptService.Modules` and `ServerScriptService.init.Modules`
   - Scripts exist in both `PlayerScripts.Modules` and `PlayerScripts.init.Modules`
   - This suggests a project structure mismatch or duplication

4. DataStoreManagerPro integration issues (Less urgent for now)

### Resolved Issues:
1. âœ… AchievementManager.luau missing variable definitions
2. âœ… BuildingChallengeManager.luau code structure issues 

### In Progress:
1. ðŸ”„ Module path structure and references (P0-001, P0-002, P1-001, P1-002, P1-004, P2-004)
2. ðŸ”„ Remotes folder creation and configuration (P0-004)

### Root Cause Analysis:
The errors suggest that there's a fundamental mismatch between:
1. How modules are organized in the file system
2. How Roblox expects to find them in the game hierarchy 
3. How scripts are trying to require them

### Recommended Solution Approach:

1. Fix module structure in ReplicatedStorage:
   - Ensure ReplicatedStorage.Shared folder exists and is properly structured
   - Implement core modules: ModuleManager, RemoteManager, Constants
   - Create a SharedModuleResolver to properly expose modules

2. Standardize script paths and references:
   - Decide whether to use ServerScriptService.Modules or ServerScriptService.init.Modules
   - Update all require paths to use a consistent pattern

3. Create Remotes folder with necessary events:
   - Add ReportObject and AdminCommand RemoteEvents
   - Ensure they are properly created before clients try to access them

4. Fix DataStoreManager references once core structure is working
   - This should be addressed after resolving the primary module structure issues

5. Test incremental fixes focusing on the highest priority modules first:
   - Start with the Shared module structure
   - Then fix server module access
   - Then address client module resolution
