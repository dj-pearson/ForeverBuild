## P0: Critical Issues

### ðŸ”„ Module Resolution Issues

- [X] **P0-001**: Syntax error in Shared module initialization
  - "Attempted to call require with invalid argument(s)" in ReplicatedStorage.Shared, Line 49
  - Fixed missing/misplaced `end` statements in Shared init.luau
  - Validated script now parses without syntax errors

- [X] **P0-002**: Module load cascade failures
  - "Requested module experienced an error while loading" seen in multiple scripts
  - Fixed by resolving the root cause (Shared module syntax errors)
  - Fixed proper folder vs script representation in project.json

- [ ] **P0-003**: RemoteManager implementation issues
  - Current implementation in Shared init.luau has a syntax error and needs to be fixed
  - RemoteEvents are created but the module fails to initialize properly
  - Needs syntax fixes and proper implementation

## P1: High Priority Issues

### ðŸ”„ Server Scripts Module Resolution

- [P] **P1-001**: Server scripts unable to access Shared module
  - Seen in ServerScriptService.init.Modules.Tutorial.TutorialHandler:6
  - Also affects ServerScriptService.Modules.Security.SecurityManager:7
  - Related to the root cause in P0-001

- [P] **P1-002**: DataStoreManager require errors
  - "Requested module experienced an error while loading" in ServerScriptService.init.Modules.Data.DataStoreManager:8
  - Also occurs in ServerScriptService.Modules.Data.DataStoreManager:8
  - Part of cascade from the Shared module error

### ðŸ”„ Client Scripts Module Resolution

- [ ] **P1-003**: PlayerScripts module initialization failures
  - "Requested module experienced an error while loading" in Players.Xdjpearsonx.PlayerScripts.init.TutorialManager:5
  - Also affects Players.Xdjpearsonx.PlayerScripts.init:6

- [X] **P1-004**: StarterGui/PlayerGui structure fixed
  - Successfully corrected the JSON structure in default.project.json
  - UI scripts are now at the correct level in the project hierarchy
  - Next step is to fix module resolution in UI scripts

## Action Items

1. Fix the syntax error in ReplicatedStorage.Shared.init.luau:
   - Examine line 49 and surrounding code for missing or misplaced `end` statements
   - Remove the extra `end` at the bottom of the file
   - Ensure proper module export syntax

2. Verify module loading after the Shared module is fixed:
   - Check if cascade errors resolve in server scripts
   - Check if cascade errors resolve in client scripts
   - Focus on fixing any remaining module path issues

3. Test RemoteManager functionality:
   - Ensure RemoteEvents are properly created
   - Verify server and client scripts can access the RemoteManager
   - Test actual remote event communication between server and client
  
- [X] **P2-005**: BuildingChallengeManager code structure issues
  - Fixed duplicate if blocks by refactoring with a `shouldAward` variable
  - Fixed empty if block implementation
  - Properly prefixed unused parameters with underscore
  - Commented out unused imports

### ðŸ”„ DataStoreManagerPro Issues

- [ ] **P2-006**: Missing modules in DataStoreManagerPro plugin
  - Multiple "Failed to resolve module" errors
  - Modules affected: CacheManager, SchemaManager, SchemaValidator, SessionManager, etc.

- [ ] **P2-007**: UI Component access errors in DataStoreManagerPro
  - Multiple "X is not a valid member of Folder/Script" errors
  - Components: APIIntegration, AccessControl, SchemaManager, StyleGuide, etc.

- [ ] **P2-008**: Invalid callback in DataExplorer
  - "Attempt to connect failed: Passed value is not a function"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src.server.DataExplorer:472

---

## P3: Low Priority Issues

### ðŸ”„ DataStore Client Access Issues

- [ ] **P3-001**: Client attempting to access DataStore
  - "DataStore can't be accessed from client"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src.server.SessionManager:27

### ðŸ”„ Init Script Issues

- [ ] **P3-002**: Missing init.server script
  - "init.server is not a valid member of Script"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src

### ðŸ”„ Nil Value Calls

- [ ] **P3-003**: Attempting to call nil values
  - "attempt to call a nil value"
  - File: DataStoreManagerPro.src.server.DataExplorer:549

### ðŸ”„ ModuleManager Dependencies

- [ ] **P3-004**: Missing ModuleManager reference
  - "ModuleManager is not a valid member of ModuleScript 'ReplicatedStorage.Shared'"
  - File: Players.Xdjpearsonx.PlayerGui.Gui:4

## Notes and Guidelines

### Key Problem Categories:
1. Path structure and module resolution issues (In progress)
   - Both server and client scripts are failing to find modules
   - The errors show that neither "shared" nor "server" modules can be accessed
   - Project has multiple module reference patterns that aren't working together

2. Missing core modules in ReplicatedStorage.Shared (In progress)
   - ModuleManager, RemoteManager, and Constants all appear to be expected in Shared

3. Multiple instance paths for the same scripts
   - Scripts exist in both `ServerScriptService.Modules` and `ServerScriptService.init.Modules`
   - Scripts exist in both `PlayerScripts.Modules` and `PlayerScripts.init.Modules`
   - This suggests a project structure mismatch or duplication

4. DataStoreManagerPro integration issues (Less urgent for now)

### Resolved Issues:
1. âœ… AchievementManager.luau missing variable definitions
2. âœ… BuildingChallengeManager.luau code structure issues 

### In Progress:
1. ðŸ”„ Module path structure and references (P0-001, P0-002, P1-001, P1-002, P1-004, P2-004)
2. ðŸ”„ Remotes folder creation and configuration (P0-004)

### Root Cause Analysis:
The errors suggest that there's a fundamental mismatch between:
1. How modules are organized in the file system
2. How Roblox expects to find them in the game hierarchy 
3. How scripts are trying to require them

I've examined the workspace structure and found:
- We have both `src/ReplicatedStorage/Shared` and direct modules in `src/ReplicatedStorage`
- Required modules exist but in different locations than scripts are looking for them
- There are duplicate paths with both `ServerScriptService.Modules` and `ServerScriptService.init.Modules`
- Many modules might be referencing paths like `ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Constants` but the actual file is directly in ReplicatedStorage

### Recommended Solution Approach:

1. Fix module structure in ReplicatedStorage (Begin Here):
   - Move `ReplicatedStorage/RemoteManager.luau` and other direct modules into `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/`
   - Ensure `SharedModuleResolver.luau` properly exposes all shared modules
   - Create a proper folder structure that matches the requires in the scripts:
     ```
     ReplicatedStorage/
       Shared/              <- Main shared modules folder
         Constants.luau     <- Constants module (referenced in many UI scripts)
         ModuleManager.luau <- Module manager (referenced in Gui:4)
         RemoteManager.luau <- Remote manager (from existing file)
         Types.luau         <- Types module
     ```

2. Create and configure the Remotes folder:
   - Add this to ServerScriptService.init.server.lua:
     ```lua
     -- Create Remotes folder and required RemoteEvents
     local Remotes = Instance.new("Folder")
     Remotes.Name = "Remotes"
     Remotes.Parent = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
     
     -- Create admin command event
     local AdminCommand = Instance.new("RemoteEvent")
     AdminCommand.Name = "AdminCommand" 
     AdminCommand.Parent = Remotes
     
     -- Create report object event
     local ReportObject = Instance.new("RemoteEvent")
     ReportObject.Name = "ReportObject"
     ReportObject.Parent = Remotes
     ```
